📖 About the Project

This project explores how cloud integrations, AI, and CI/CD automation can enhance services within UCL’s ISD ecosystem.
We built a solution that demonstrates:

Scalable cloud-native infrastructure.

Intelligent automation powered by AI and data analytics.

A continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline to streamline development.

Our approach aligns with UCL ISD’s focus on modern cloud adoption, security, and automation.

✨ Features

🔹 Serverless Compute – AWS Lambda functions for event-driven workflows.

🔹 Data Processing Pipeline – Handles real-time and batch data.

🔹 AI/ML Integration – AWS SageMaker for model training and deployment.

🔹 Storage & Databases – Amazon S3 and DynamoDB for scalable storage.

🔹 Authentication & Security – IAM roles and policies for fine-grained access control.

🔹 CI/CD – Automated deployments with GitHub Actions + AWS CodePipeline.

🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript

Cloud Platform: AWS (Lambda, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, SageMaker, CloudWatch, IAM)

CI/CD Tools: GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline

Infrastructure as Code: AWS CloudFormation / Terraform

Version Control: Git + GitHub
